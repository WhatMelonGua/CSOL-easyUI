# CSOL-easyUI
A third-party library. It is more convenient to build the UI interface of CSOL (based on lua)! Third-party plug-ins and lua tool library are provided! Visualize the UI and deploy it in one line of code!

Look for codes in folder easyUI

UI.BoxPainter - a app for UI.Box painting base on browser
API document - look for functions to use here
easyUI(inner) - the code of the lua package ,Lanapixel is the font file

thanks for use!
